Great Work!

Amazing job building a full game loop with players, bots, collisions, scoring, and menus — that’s impressive!

Your menus and HUD are interactive and polished, which makes the game feel complete.

Using threads for the win banner and asynchronous actions shows strong understanding of program behavior.

This project would look excellent in a portfolio.

Tips for Improvement

Consider splitting responsibilities: separating game logic, rendering, and input handling can make your code easier to manage.

Reduce repetition by creating helper methods for repeated tasks like deleting and drawing UI elements.

Replace magic numbers with constants to improve readability and make tweaking the game easier.

Overall, a very solid, portfolio-worthy project — keep building and refining!
